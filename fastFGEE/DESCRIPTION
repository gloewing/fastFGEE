Description: fastFGEE fits functional generalized estimating equations (fGEE) with a one-step estimator for binary, count, and continuous longitudinal functional outcomes. By using a one-step estimator, the method scales to large datasets. Currently allows for pointwise independence, exchangeable, and AR1 working correlation structures although there exists some basic functionality for general working correlation structures.
